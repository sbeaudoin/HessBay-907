# HessBay-907
Intelligent soldering iron project based on an arduino mega and a Hakko 907 soldering iron.

This is a pre-alpha project.  Really, I am a beginner in electronics and I touched an arduino a month ago, what do you expect?

This project will be my beginning in IoT and specifically, based on the Arduino Mega 2560.  Also, this will use basic to medium level of electronics, so it is an occasion to be better in this domain.  Finally, I am a french Canadian from the province of Quebec, so, I will practice my english.

The goal of the project is to make an intelligent soldering station where you can set a specific temperature for up to 3 profiles.  It will be compatible with the hakko 907 soldering iron who can be purchased cheap from AliExpress for about $7 and it includes a temperature probe.  It will also have a 480x320 color LCD screen to display the informations.  All this will be managed by an Arduino Mega 2560.

As I am a professional developer, the first step is to build code.  Sp√©cifically, the user interface.  This is the most difficult part and I want to test if the LCD panel and the Arduino model I selected works fine for this project.  

So, don't expect a finished product soon, except if I change the version type to beta.
